# micecraft
2D block based module inside Transformice.

For building the Module, do:
1. Clone the repository into your device.
2. Run the merger.lua file
3. A new file called 'micecraft.lua' will appear, which then can be loaded in Transformice.

Stable releases may be found on the `main` branch, while active developing versions may be found on the `development` branch.
